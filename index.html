A few year later he had some laser tattoo removal sessions to lighten the double tattoo. In the meantime, him and San Diego tattoo artist (IG: @terryribera) sat down and planned the tattoo out. 'He actually texted me a few weeks later before the first appointment and had changed the design to something more in your face and dynamic. I was in love with the design! At this point in my career I had been on 7 deployments and seen over 30 countries with just about 16-17 years in service. 3 sessions later I was so proud to wear this new ink from Terry that represents who I am.

            "'So I Served from 2011 to 2015. Basic/AIT was at Fort Leonard Wood. Then I went to Airborne school at Fort Benning. Soon after that I found myself at Fort Bragg in 'The Nasty.' Me, my wife and 6month old son moved into our new home on base August 2011. Things between me and my wife started to get really bad towards the end of 2011. By February 2012 CPS was involved because of my wife's erratic behavior and actions that put our son's life in danger multiple times. Me and my wife separated. She and our son stayed on base in our house and my Commander put my in the barracks. The day after our son turned one years old we had a court date on February 15th 2012. The judge ordered that our son be placed in foster care due to my wife's behavior. He could not give custody to me because I was staying in the barracks. For the next few months I was fighting for custody of my son. During this time I received a tremendous amount of help from my battle buddies in 'The Nasty.' I didn't even have a car because my wife had it. One of my best friends drove me to social services every Friday for my supervised visit with my son. The amount of stories and things that happened would take a long time to explain. The reason for this tattoo is because I am blessed and grateful to be a party of 'The Nasty.' So many battle buddies helped me out. In April 2012, I was able to afford my own place off base (I was no longer able to live on base because of my wife). A few weeks later I was awarded full custody of my son and my wife has not seen him since her last supervised visit March 2012. This tattoo is a constant reminder of how lucky I was to have the support of 'The Nasty.' They helped me out during the toughest moments of my life.'",
